LIST OF RECENT PIHPSDR CHANGES
==============================

November 2023:
--------------

- integrated the WDSP source code tree into piHPSDR,
  and do a static linking against WDSP. This way,
  the files /usr/local/include/wdsp.h and
  /usr/local/lib/libwdsp.so (MacOS: libwdsp.dylib) are
  no longer used and no longer referenced (except
  when compiling with the EXTNR compile time option).

- Corrections for legacy USB/OZY radios to work with
  two Mercury cards (contribution from Rick). I took the
  occasionto "polish" the OZY code somewhat.

- re-worked the "analog input lines" from the radio.
  The "Display Warnings" checkbox now applies to
  sequence errors, TX fifo under/over-runs, and high SWR.
  The "Display PA current" checkbox now applies to
  the PA temperature (HL2 only), the PA current and the
  PA supply voltage.

- added PTTOUT and CWOUT to the "extra GPIO lines",
  and wrote an Appendix G in the manual to cover
  that subject.

- increase number of memory slots from  5 to 10.

- added 6.25k anhd 12.5 to the VFO step sizes

- changed meaning of the "Mute Audio to Radio" button

- added check-boxes for muting the speaker amp (RADIO menu)
  and by-passing RF frontend filters (RX menu)

- added a pushbutton action to open the main menu

- included support for "full cycle" and "half cycle" encoders,
  and take "half cycles" for the double-encoders in the V2
  and G2 controllers

October 2022:
-------------

- limit the "CW PTT delay" to 900/speed, to work around a
  peculiarity of the FPGA keyers

- show commit info in "About" menu, and mark versions with
  changed files as "dirty"

- moved "Display Zoom/Pan" and friends to the SCREEN menu,
  "Frames per Second", "Filled" and "Gradient" in the RX
  menu only affect that RX, and added "Frames per Second"
  and "Filled" to the TX menu.

- full buffering before and after WDSP, to reduce drop-outs

- Makefile: Syntax of choosing compile-time options improved

- renamed the "FFT" menu to "DSP", and added "Binaural" check boxes
  to the receivers.

- CAT commands which do not specify a VFO now operate on VFO A
  (they used to operate on the VFO of the active receiver)
  since this is the behaviour found e.g. in TS2000.

September 2023:
--------------

- Added a "Defaults" button to the Encoder and Switch menus, as to
  restore the default assignment.

- Added U and D keyboard short cuts which move the VFO of the non-active
  receiver by 10 VFO step sizes up or down

- Show CTCSS frequency in the VFO bar, and store it in the memory slots
  and band stack entries.

- added further "Watt values", e.g. 5W for the HermesLite-II

- added "Reset" button to the Watt meter calibration in the PA menu

August 2023:
------------

- added "CW audio peak filter" box in the Filter menu (when doing CW).
  Indicate the audio peak filter in the VFO bar by adding a "P" to the
  filter width

- re-organized most of the Menus

- consistently use CSS. Allow for dark GTK themes

- support for ANDROMEDA controller in the CAT handler (rigctl)

- automatic installation procedures for LINUX and MacOS

- in-depth (200 pages) manual now available and part ot
  the piHPSDR source code tree.

July 2023:
----------

- added Saturn/G2 support

- a new SCREEN menu featuring dynamic window resizing and
  a selectable VFO bar layout

- PURESIGNAL now works with ANAN-10E and ANAN-100B

- HermesLite-II "smooth drive slider" code

- TX menu: max drive level for digi modes can now be specified

June 2023:
----------

- changed the semantics of the "Hide" button (hide Toolbar, Slider
  and Zoom/Pan area) and introduced a "Iconify" button in the main
  menu

- VFO frequency settings via rigcl "numpad" functions

- Use new "voice sequelch" function (since WDSP 1.21) for SSB

- touch-screen friendly pop-down menus (combo-boxes) are now the
  default if a controller is used.

March 2023:
-----------

- AF gain: changed from amplitude 0-100 to gain -40 - 0 dB

- do not show PURESIGNAL status when doing CW, since WDSP
  is by-passed anyway

- changes to support both the light and dark GTK theme

- if using two receivers on two different bands with ADC0,
  adjust the HPF/LPF settings such that both bands fall
  into the pass-band.

- introduced file appearance.h defining all the colours and font
  sizes in the panadapters

Jan 2023:
---------


- TX menu: specify the tune drive level as an absolute number, not
  relative to the current drive slider position


August 2022
-----------

- New value for the "CW RF delay" (30 msec), based on measurement 
  with my ANAN-7000 (with the new value, no "chopping" of the first
  dot is observed any longer). 

- Disable T/R relay if PA is disabled, this works around a but in the
  FPGA firmware

July 2022
---------

- Support for HermesLite-II with an audio codec

- CW keying via GPIO/MIDI using an external keyer

April 2022
----------

- introduced touch-screen friendly combo-boxes. Both popping up
  and item selection now require a "button release" event.

January 2022
------------

- added possibility to manually adjust the attenuation for PURESIGNAL
  with a spin-button in the PS menu

- fixes for legacy hardware (USB-OZY, METIS, Penelope, Janus)

- "routed UDB" discovery possible

- silenced first RX samples after a TX/RX transition since they contain
  the own TX signal (from crosstalk at the T/R relay)
